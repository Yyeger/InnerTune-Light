# InnerTune-Light

A Lighter Material 3 YouTube Music client for Android

Just an excuse to start studying android developing and more importantly helping a FOSS project that i use often,
i'll start by removing some stuff that i don't really use or like and then i'll add some new features.
When i'll feel ready i might start creating pull request to the original repo.

UPDATE: not using this app anymore, not even using android anymore. For the moments the projects is stalled!
